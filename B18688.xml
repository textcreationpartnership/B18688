            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CASE OF THE <hi>Manufacturers of Grograin Yarn.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THAT since the Settlement of Manufacturing <hi>Raw Silk</hi> and <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grain Yarn</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> great Multitudes of People have Increased and been Maintain'd, the Productions of our Lands Expended, and Navigation improved by the Exportation of our <hi>Wooll</hi> fully Manufactured to <hi>Turky, Italy,</hi> and again return'd in the aforesaid <hi>Raw Silk</hi> and <hi>Grograin Yarn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That 'tis apparent the great Preference lately and now given to Foreign Wrought Silks and Stuffs, hath Ruined most, and so discouraged all the <hi>Silk-Weavers</hi> and <hi>Throwsters;</hi> for that the <hi>Mercers</hi> of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,</hi> finding the Fond Humours of the Female Sex will not be pleased or contented without them, though at double the true Value thereof; and unless they purchase them, though at those Rates, the <hi>Drapers</hi> will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive them of their Trades, bend all their Care, Estates and Credits to Trade therein, and the <hi>English Weavers</hi> and <hi>Throwsters</hi> are thereby Undone and Ruined.</p>
            <p>That these Manufacturers of <hi>London,</hi> for some time past, could find no Ways to preserve their Poor from Starving, but by interfering with the Trade of <hi>Norwich,</hi> and other Woollen Manufacturers, except in that Branch of <hi>Grograin Yarn,</hi> which alwayes was, and chiefly is, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Return of our Coarse English Wooll-Cloths fully Manufactured, and by Winding, Doubling, Twisting, Weaving, Dying, Dressing, and Callendering thereof, doth give vast Imployment to multitudes both of Men, Women and Children; as hath been made plainly appear before this Honourable House, and shall again, if required.</p>
            <p>That he which wears a <hi>Hair-Camblet</hi> Cloak or Coat, <hi>Hair-Prunelloe</hi> or <hi>Camblet</hi> Gown, Advanceth the great Interest of <hi>England</hi> in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption of our own Wooll, with all the Advantage of its several Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facturies, and the like in the Return of Raw <hi>Grograin Yarn,</hi> as aforesaid; whereas he that wears a Cloak, Sute, or Coat, or pleads in a Gown of above Fourteen Shillings <hi>per</hi> Yard, bought in <hi>Blackwell-Hall, <hi>Consumes not One Dram of English Wooll.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore 'tis Humbly Hoped this Honourable House will not Prohibit the Wearing of Hair Stuffs, in regard the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacturers thereof have no other Branch of the Weaving Trade to Imploy themselves for their Support and Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood.</p>
